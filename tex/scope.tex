\section{Event mention scope}

The extent of an event is the scope in which it arguments and co-reference can be tagged.
It determines to boundaries of one single event instance.
We define to extent of an event to be at the \textbf{document-level}.
This means that event arguments and attributes can cross sentence boundaries.

As discussed in \ref{chapter/eventtype}, arguments can be tagged anywhere in the same document.
This means 
We do prefer 

\tagged{full}{
This corresponds with Rich ERE but differs from ACE and Light ERE which are sentence-level.
}
