	    A dividend is a distribution of a portion of a company's earnings, decided by the board of directors, paid to a class of its shareholders. We also include other types of capital returns in this type such as share buybacks and ROC. Dividends can be issued as cash payments, as shares of stock, or other property. A dividend is a payment made by a corporation to its shareholders, usually as a distribution of profits. When a corporation earns a profit or surplus, the corporation is able to re-invest the profit in the business (called retained earnings) and pay a proportion of the profit as a dividend to shareholders. Distribution to shareholders may be in cash (usually a deposit into a bank account). Investors often view the company’s dividend by its dividend yield which measures the dividend in terms of a percent of the current market price. The dividend rate can also be quoted in terms of the dollar amount each share receives (dividends per share, or DPS). Includes forecasts, reports, announcements, quotations and speculation on dividends and capital returns.

    \item \hypertarget{expensevsrevenue}{\textbf{Overlap} with \type{Revenue}}: Revenue is money a company earns from conducting business. Expenses are the costs you incur to generate that revenue. The ingredients you buy to make the ice cream, the wages you pay your employees, the rent and utilities you pay for your stand -- these are all expenses. To remain viable, a company's revenue must exceed its expenses. Revenue is often referred to as the "top line" because it sits at the top of the income statement.
    \item \hypertarget{expensevsprofitloss}{\textbf{Overlap} with \type{Profit/Loss}}: \type{Profit/Loss} captures total earnings or net income (AKA "the bottom line"). It consists of the gross revenue minus all expenses. A reduction in expenses can lead to increased earnings.
    \item \hypertarget{expensevssalesvolume}{\textbf{Overlap} with \type{SalesVolume}}: \type{SalesVolume} events capture changes in the amount of product/service sales or consumers/subscriptions. The volume of sales impacts revenue and expenses. Variable operating expenses (such as delivery costs) closely associated with, and varying in close proportion to, changes in the total sales volume. Although not listed separately in income statement, these expenses are an important item of management accounts.
    \item \hypertarget{expensevsinvestment}{\textbf{Overlap}} with \type{Investment}: \type{Expenses} and \type{Investments} both incur costs to a business. An investment is an expense for which the primary purpose is to change the future revenue or cost structure of the enterprise. An investment involves an expected future return, while an expense is a cost to cover current operations, production, etc. 
    \item \hypertarget{expensevsrevenue}{\textbf{Overlap}} with \type{Revenue}:	A business can incur expenses that relate to acquiring revenue in the short-term, i.e. "revenue expenses". Revenue expenses will be tagged under the \type{Expense} type which is typically associated with capital expenses. The difference between revenue expenses and capital expenses is that revenue expenses are one-time costs instead of gradual over-time capital expense. These involve fixed one-time costs related to real estate, factory equipment, computers, office furniture, and other physical capital asset or intangible assets such as intellectual property, copyrights, patents, trademarks, et. al. Whenever a revenue expense is discussed we tag \type{Expense}.
    \item Keywords: operating expense, capital cost, cost saving, revenue expenditure.
    \item OPEX vs. CAPEX: We include both revenue types in \type{Revenue}. What follows is an explanation of the difference for clarification: Capital expenditure should not be confused with revenue expenditure or operating expenses (OPEX). Revenue expenses are shorter-term expenses required to meet the ongoing operational costs of running a business, and therefore they are essentially identical to operating expenses. Unlike capital expenditures, revenue expenses can be fully tax-deducted in the same year in which the expenses occur. (cf. \url{https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capitalexpenditure.asp}) While these types of expense are different in accounting because of US taxation and legal reasons, we combine them under one event as they capture the cost of operating a company.

In accounting terms, sales make up one component of a company's revenue. On an income statement, sales are usually referred to as gross sales or "the top line" since sales are often used interchangeably with revenue. If your revenues are increasing but your net profits are not, that is a sure sign your expenses are up. Sales is the leading indicator for most companies, so most companies track sales closely.

\section{FILLER arguments} \label{sec:FILLERtypes}

\justify
For information on when to annotate FILLER arguments, see \fullref{sec:FILLERargtagg}.
For the event ontology, we describe conceptual and taggability properties of individual FILLER arguments here.

\subsection{Universal FILLER Arguments: TIME, PLACE, CAPITAL}

\justify
Universal FILLER arguments are applicable to all events regardless of type and subtype.
Annotators should always be aware and looking for these FILLER arguments.
These arguments are universal because they are highly probable to be associated with any economic event:
An event is inherently temporal (\type{TIME}) and locational (\type{PLACE}): it occurs somewhere and takes up some point or duration in time.
In economic news, events often carry a cost or involve an amount of money. For this, we introduce the \type{CAPITAL} FILLER argument.

\hypertarget{TIME}{
\subsubsection{TIME}}

\justify
\noindent\textbf{On types and subtypes}: all.\\[6pt]
\noindent\textbf{Conceptually}:
A TIME is a temporal expression that corresponds to a specific duration and point in time.
This includes calendar dates (e.g., "October 29", "June 2017", "the 24th of April") but also relative time descriptions (e.g., "yesterday". "last week", "next year") and durations (e.g, "the coming months", "over five years").\\

\noindent\textbf{Taggability}:\\
The full nominal constituent NP of the duration of time point will be tagged.
This includes pre- and post-modifiers and excludes the preposition that is the head of the TIME noun phrase.

\begin{exe}
    \ex \annexe{In [ \exargfill{2017} ], the company announced their desire for entering the Chinese market.}
    \ex \annexe{The decision to replace the executive will be made [ \exargfill{next Thursday} ].}
    \ex \annexe{The leaders met [ \exargfill{last week} ] in Lagos.}
    \ex \annexe{They have been working on the deal for [ \exargfill{the better part of a year} ]. }
    \ex \annexe{The park will open [ \exargfill{Monday 23 June} ].}
    \ex \annexe{The Boeing Corp. announced the deal [ \exargfill{yesterday after Trump's visit to Iran} ].}
\end{exe}

\vspace{0.5cm}

\hypertarget{PLACE}{
\subsubsection{PLACE}}

\justify
\noindent\textbf{On types and subtypes}: all.\\[6pt]
\noindent\textbf{Conceptually}:\\
PLACE encompasses specific mentions of geographic locations.
It refers to places (e.g., "Wall Street", "The White House", "Downing Street"), cities (e.g., "Washington", "Detroit"), countries ("US", ""), states (e.g., "Oregon", "Kentucky"), regions (e.g., "Central-Asia", "the Champagne region", "the fourth district", "CBD" (Central Business District)), and markets expressed as geographic locations (e.g., "the Indian market"). We also include nicknames (e.g., "the Big Apple", "Motor City").\\

\noindent\textbf{Taggability}:\\
The full NP containing the location expression is tagged.
This includes pre- and post-modifiers and not the preposition that is the head of the PLACE noun phrase.

\tagged{full}{
Rich ERE does not tag location FILLER arguments.
This information is particularly important for many economic events as business is legally bound by market and geography.)
}

\vspace{0.5cm}


\hypertarget{CAPITAL}{
\subsubsection{CAPITAL}}

\justify
\noindent\textbf{On types and subtypes}: all.\\[6pt]
\noindent\textbf{Conceptually}:
Financial capital is any economic resource measured in terms of money used by entrepreneurs and businesses to buy what they need to make their products or to provide their services to the sector of the economy upon which their operation is based, i.e. retail, corporate, investment banking, etc.

A \type{CAPITAL} FILLER argument is the amount of money (or securities or commodities that hold transactional value) that is associated with an event. It is usually described in terms of the currency of some country or region (e.g., "US Dollars", "\$", "USD" or "Euros", "EUR"), but can also be expressed in an amount of securities, equity or debt (e.g., "1.5 million dollars in stock", "27,000 shares" or "3.7 million in Covered Bonds").\\

\noindent\textbf{\type{CAPITAL} vs. similar Participant arguments}:
Many event types have a Participant argument such as \type{Cost}, \type{Amount} or \type{Capital} that is conceptually similar to this FILLER argument.
However \type{CAPITAL} has other taggability rules w.r.t. Event Mention Scope - being a FILLER argument: 
Unlike the similar Participant arguments, \type{CAPITAL} can be tagged from anywhere in the document preferring the closest mention.
If a similar Participant argument is in Event Mention Scope tagging the argument \emph{always} takes precedence over tagging that mention as FILLER \type{CAPITAL}.
Furthermore, FILLER arguments are always nominal constituents and can never be pronominal unlike Participant arguments. \\

\noindent\textbf{Taggability}:
The extent of money a CAPITAL mention encompasses the full NP in which the capital amount is mentioned.
It needs to include modifying constituents as well as monetary units.
This includes quantifying adjective phrases (e.g., "almost", "a large amount of", "almost") and qualifying adjectives (e.g., "large", "exuberant", "plentiful").

\begin{exe}
    \ex \annexe{The company invested [ \exargfill{nearly 230 million dollars} ] in the newly founded lab.}
    \ex \annexe{Facebook faces fines of [ \exargfill{up to 11 billion Euros} ] if they do not comply with GDPR.}
    \ex \annexe{XYZ Corp. acquired [ \exargfill{18000 shares} ] in a 1:2 acquisition stock deal.}
    \ex \annexe{The position involves [ \exargfill{a plentiful \$~1,200,000 signing bonus} ].}
\end{exe}

\tagged{full}{
Similar to Rich ERE MONEY (MON) arguments, but in taggability resembles the COMMODITY (COM) filler argument. (cf., DEFT Rich ERE Annotation Guidelines: Argument Fillers v2.3 p11)
}

\vspace{0.5cm}


\subsection{Type-Specific FILLER Arguments}
These FILLER arguments are only tagged when they belong to a specific \type{type} or \type{subtype}.

\hypertarget{SENTENCE}{
\subsubsection{SENTENCE}}

\justify
\noindent\textbf{On types and subtypes}: \type{Legal.Conviction/Settlement}.\\[6pt]
\noindent\textbf{Conceptually}:\\
A conviction is formal declaration by the verdict of a jury or the decision of a judge in a court of law that someone is guilty of a criminal offence.
A settlement is an official agreement intended to resolve a dispute or conflict.
Both are the outcome of a formal allegation in which one party is forced to a penalty by the court or the litigating party.
\\[6pt]
\noindent\textbf{Taggability}:\\
The full NP containing the sentence is tagged including any determiners, articles, pre- and post-modifiers.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\hypertarget{ALLEGATION}{
\subsubsection{ALLEGATION}}

\justify
\noindent\textbf{On types and subtypes}: any \type{Legal} type.\\[6pt]
\noindent\textbf{Conceptually}:
Allegation or other formal/legal offence that is alleged against a defendant.
ALLEGATION is tagged whenever an crime, misconduct or other offense is formally alleged against a company, organization or person.
\\[6pt]
\noindent\textbf{Taggability}:
The full NP containing the sentence is tagged including any determiners, articles, pre- and post-modifiers.

\vspace{0.5cm}

\hypertarget{TITLE}{
\subsubsection{TITLE}}

\justify
\noindent\textbf{On types and subtypes}: any \type{Employment} type.\\[6pt]
\noindent\textbf{Conceptually}:
The job title/position of the an Employee or a certain professional role, type of worker.
Titles are the personal titles and honorifics, official rank or status, and specific employed occupations or professional positions. Annotators will need to use best judgment when determining whether a position or occupation is specific enough to be tagged as a title (e.g., general types such as worker, official, member, employee, will not be tagged TITLE).\\[6pt]

\noindent\textbf{Taggability}:\\
For our purposes, the extent of a TITLE is limited to the string of text that describes the position or rank itself, independent of its organizational circumstances or relationships, and excluding a preceding definite article (‘the’) and any other pre-posed or post-posed modifiers.

Because TITLEs occur in conjunction with other entities and refer to other entities, they have some special rules. The most frequent constructions TITLEs occur in are title + name, appositives, and copula constructions.

Just as with appositives, all titles, positions, and honorifics will be marked separately from the individual's name.

\section{Event Type Conceptualization Notes}

\subsection{Continuous vs. Categorical change}
Many events in this typology express some form of change: either in rating, price, value, or some other observable result.
Among these events we can distinguish changes that apply to continuous values and categorical values.
A continuous event is a SalesVolume or SecurityPrice event.
A real price value changes gradually over time and the event structure captures a snapshot of this change.
A categorical change are Financial Report and Rating change. 
We expect the event trigger to inherently signal the change in value rather than a verb
as a predicate taking arguments that signal the change.

For instance, Rating\_Buy does not have a Participant argument Rating for its "buy" rating as the event type itself would be expressed by the mention of "buy".
The would-be Rating Participant argument is necessary for making the subtype distinction and therefore co-opted by the trigger extent.
This is unlike Continuous events which are more likely to be triggered by a verb that takes multiple semantic arguments: SecurityValue\_Increase inherently involves a historical price trend and a current price as Participant argument.
The process of increasing itself can easily be expressed by standalone verbs such as "increase", "grow", "go up".

% ISSUES:

% In SentiFM: you have subtypes based on attributes of the events: whether it is an announcement, cancellation, forecast, buy-rating/sell\_rating/hold\_rating etc. Some of these categories are
% => What to do with Forecasts and announcements: Boudoukh 2012 Sees this as a separate event and generalizes over the outcome of the forecast e.g. Guidance Change Growth (Guidance = forecast released by company on earnings/revenue; typically includes revenue estimates, along with earnings, margins and capital spending estimates; it is also known as "earnings guidance.")
